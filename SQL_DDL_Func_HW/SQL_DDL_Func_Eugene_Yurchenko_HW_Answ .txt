4.1 Q: What operations do the following functions perform: film_in_stock, film_not_in_stock, inventory_in_stock, get_customer_balance,
inventory_held_by_customer, rewards_report, last_day? You can find these functions in dvd_rental database.
	A:	film_in_stock - receives on entry film_id and store_id. Received Inventory_id and check that Inventory_id in fuction inventory_in_stock.
					If fuction inventory_in_stock return TRUE
					We get in exit table with inventory_id free on the store (for the specified film_id and store_id)
					
	film_not_in_stock - receives on entry film_id and store_id. Received Inventory_id and check that Inventory_id in fuction inventory_in_stock.
					If fuction inventory_in_stock return FALSE
					We get in exit table with inventory_id out of store (for the specified film_id and store_id) 
					
	inventory_in_stock - receives on entry inventory_id. Count rental_id where return_date is NULL. 
					If Count rental_id More than zero - return FALSE - film not return to store
					If Count rental_id More is zero - return TRUE - film in store
					
	get_customer_balance - Calculate the customer balance regarding date and rules
					balance = FEES PAID TO RENT THE VIDEOS INITIALLY + LATE FEES FOR PRIOR RENTALS - SUM OF PAYMENTS MADE PREVIOUSLY
					
	inventory_held_by_customer - Select customer_id from rental table where return_date IS NULL
	
	rewards_report - Check correct insert data - if data incorrect - we get message.
					Create a temporary storage area for Customer IDs.
					Find all customers meeting the monthly purchase requirements and add customer_id in temporary storage area
					Output ALL customer information of matching rewardees.
					Drop temporary storage area for Customer IDs
	last_day - 	RETURNS date - last day of month for IN date
					Check Month. If month = 12 then get date like first January next year minus one day
					ELSE EXTRACT month + 1 and minus one day
					
4.2 Q:	Why does ‘rewards_report’ function return 0 rows? Correct and recreate the function, so that it's able to return rows properly.				
					
	A:	I think ‘rewards_report’ return 0 rows, because we calculate report period like CURRENT_DATE - '3 month' = September 2022
					But all our records did from January to May 2017
					I think we need replace CURRENT_DATE to SELECT MAX(p2.payment_date) FROM payment p2)
					
4.3 Q:	Is there any function that can potentially be removed from the dvd_rental codebase? If so, which one and why?
	A:	I think we can remove inventory_in_stock and change it inventory_held_by_customer. 
					If we get customer_id Then we don`t have inventory in stock
4.4 Q:	The ‘get_customer_balance’ function describes the business requirements for calculating the client balance. Unfortunately, not all of
					them are implemented in this function. Try to change function using the requirements from the comments.
					
	A:	Declareted v_overdue INTEGER; --  IF A FILM IS MORE THAN RENTAL_DURATION * 2 OVERDUE, CHARGE THE REPLACEMENT_COST
					And calculate:
					
					SELECT COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
                        WHEN (rental.return_date - rental.rental_date) > (film.rental_duration *2 * '1 day'::interval)
                        THEN replacement_cost
                        ELSE 0
                        END),0) 
                        INTO v_overdue
						FROM rental, inventory, film
						WHERE film.film_id = inventory.film_id
      AND inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
      AND rental.rental_date <=  p_effective_date
      AND rental.customer_id = p_customer_id
      ;
					RETURN v_rentfees + v_overfees + v_overdue - v_payments;
	
4.5	Q:	How do ‘group_concat’ and ‘_group_concat’ functions work? (database creation script might help) Where are they used?
	A:	_group_concat - used to Concatenate two text value in one text value $1 || ', ' || $2 
		group_concat - Aggregation function based on tmp function _group_concat
		group_concat - used in VIEW actor_info, film_list, nicer_but_slower_film_list. For Aggregatio in one field Category name and title. or First and last name srveral time for one film or actor
		Loke function sum(amount) by customer_id - aggregate amount for  each customer. And group_concat aggregate text data
		
4.6	Q:	What does ‘last_updated’ function do? Where is it used? 
	A:	last_updated - used to create triger for each tables. It triger shows date and time when data was update. F.e. Column year in film table.
4.7	Q:	What is tmpSQL variable for in ‘rewards_report’ function? Can this function be recreated without EXECUTE statement and dynamic SQL?
		Why?
	A:	tmpSQL stored table cust customer_id group by input min amount_purchased and min monthly_purchases
					I think we can dont create tmp table. and move this Select in "FOR rr IN EXECUTE" part. like inner join with table Customer
					We will get only customers corresponding to the specified selection conditions
